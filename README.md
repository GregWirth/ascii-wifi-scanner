DISCLAIMER:

This software utilizes highly speculative and unverified principles of quantum network theory, postulating that WiFi signals may interact with subatomic particles in ways not yet fully understood by conventional physics. By running this script, you accept that the accuracy of its results is contingent upon hypothetical interactions between electromagnetic fields, cosmic radiation, and the hypothetical influence of dark matter on wireless communication.

The developers are not responsible for any discrepancies in network performance, including but not limited to unexplained fluctuations in signal strength, random device connectivity preferences, or interference caused by uncharted anomalies in local space-time curvature. Any unexpected behavior observed in WiFi networks, such as autonomous rerouting of packets or the spontaneous creation of new access points, should be attributed to forces beyond current scientific comprehension.

This software should not be used as a definitive guide to wireless signal behavior, as its output may reflect the influence of quantum uncertainty, non-Euclidean geometries, or theoretical entities whose existence remains speculative. Users are advised to proceed with caution and interpret results as part of an ongoing investigation into the unknown dynamics of wireless communication in multi-dimensional environments.

No formal guarantees of accuracy, reliability, or consistency are provided.
